[OpenCV 3.0](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv)

[Opencv_contrib](https://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib)

Project built using Qt 5.x

##Purpose
The project contains OpenCV algorithm samples, taken from various sources. The purpose is to keep a repository of useful algorithms
and keep a reference project showing how to integrate Qt with OpenCV.

##Some included algorithms
* Edge detection
* filtering
* cartoonifying
* image morphing
* projective transformations
* feature detection and comparing

##Todo
* face recognition
* object detection
* OpenCL
