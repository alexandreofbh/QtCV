QtCV
===

A collection of OpenCV 3.0 sample algorithms integrated with a Qt GUI. 

Dependencies
==

[OpenCV 3.0](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv)

[Opencv_contrib](https://github.com/itseez/opencv_contrib)

Project built Qt Creator 3.0.1 and Qt 5.2.1

Project built and tested in Linux  (Ubuntu 14.x) environment.

##Purpose
The project contains OpenCV algorithm samples, taken from various sources. The purpose is to keep a repository of useful algorithms and sample applications of algorithms, and to keep a reference project showing how to integrate Qt with OpenCV.

##Some included algorithms
* Edge detection
* filtering
* cartoonifying
* image morphing
* projective transformations
* feature detection and comparing

##Todo
* face recognition
* object detection
* OpenCL
  
## Sources
Some algorithms were taken and / or modified from

*opencv.org*

*OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook*

*Mastering OpenCV*
